### Yakuza Linux
## Yakuza styled ArchLInux dotfiles
These are the configuration files I use for my personal laptop. This repository includes:
- Configuration files for:
    - Kitty
    - Hyprland
    - nvim
    - Waybar
    - swaync

Feel free to use them according to your needs. Keep in mind i'm still experimenting and adding new featues, so there won't be a general release until I'm satisfied in how it looks.
In the future I'm planning to do a fully automated installation if people really want to have it the same way
